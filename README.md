# Gap
Flutter widgets for easily adding gaps inside Flex widgets such as Columns and Rows or scrolling views.

### Introduction

When it comes to add empty space between widgets inside a `Column` or a `Row`, we have multiple options:
- We can either add a `Padding` around these widgets but it's very verbose
- Or we can add `SizedBox` widgets between them.

`Gap` is another option. It's like `SizedBox` but you don't have to know if it's inside a `Row` or a `Column`. So that it's less verbose than using a `SizedBox`.

## Getting started

In your library add the following import:

```dart
import 'package:gap/gap.dart';
```

Then you just have to add a `Gap` inside a `Column` or a `Row` with the specified extent.

```dart
return Column(
  children: <Widget>[
    Container(color: Colors.red, height: 20),
    const Gap(20), // Adds an empty space of 20 pixels.
    Container(color: Colors.red, height: 20),
  ],
);
```

The `Gap` widget also works inside `Scrollable` widgets such as `ListViews`. In these cases, it will occupy the space in the same direction as the `Scrollable`.

### MaxGap

This package also comes with a `MaxGap` widget.
The `MaxGap` widget will try to fill the available space in a `Column` or a `Row` with the specified size. If the available space
is lesser than the specified size, the `MaxGap` widget will only take the available space.

It's useful when you want to have a gap that shrinks to avoid an overflow otherwise.


### Other parameters

By default a `Gap` will have no extent in the opposite direction of the `Flex` parent.
If you want the `Gap` to have a color, you'll have to set the `color` and the `crossAxisExtent` parameters.
You can also use the `Gap.expand` constructor to expand the `Gap` in the opposite direction of the `Flex` parent.

### SliverGap

There is also a Sliver version of the `Gap` widget:

```dart
return CustomScrollView(
  slivers: <Widget>[
    const SliverGap(20), // Adds an empty space of 20 pixels.
  ],
);
```

### List<Widget> Extension

You can also space a list of Widgets using the gap extension

```dart
return Row(
  children: [
    Icon(Icons.abc),
    Icon(Icons.air),
    Icon(Icons.add),
  ].gap(10),
);
```
